Read the yellow banner. This repo is archived and the plugin will never be available.

### Before you ask
- [**The endpoint this plugin uses can no longer be used as Discord has patched it.**]()
  - This means any other plugin for other client mods will NOT WORK.
  - Any plugin claiming such is not true.
- DiscordInjections is dead, The repo itself is now private because of it. (don't make me private this too)
  - If you still want client mods, use Powercord.
- Do not DM me about this plugin.
